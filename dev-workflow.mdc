we will use task master to guide our Development. always follow prime directives, 
employ the development worflow process and reference the command list when needed.



**Common Taskmaster Commands**
# Initialize a new project
task-master init

# Parse a PRD and generate tasks
task-master parse-prd your-prd.txt

# List all tasks
task-master list

# Show the next task to work on
task-master next

# Show specific task(s) - supports comma-separated IDs
task-master show 1,3,5

# Research fresh information with project context
task-master research "What are the latest best practices for JWT authentication?"

# Generate task files
task-master generate

# Add rules after initialization
task-master rules add windsurf,roo,vscode

**Prime Directives***

assume all cli installed on system
look at vcluster-knative.sh script if you need to interact with aws and prompt user
use context7 for any task that requires any library versions, dont use whats stated in the tasks
use github mcp if you need to interact with github
prioritise using func cli to setup souce repo's, unless task too complicated for func cli, then setup manually

**Development Workflow Process**

- Begin coding sessions with `task-master list` to see current tasks, status, and IDs

- Select tasks based on dependencies (all marked 'done'), priority level, and ID order
- Clarify tasks by checking task files in .taskmaster/tasks directory or asking for user input
- View specific task details using `task-master show <id>` to understand implementation requirements

- Implement code following task details, dependencies, and project standards
- Verify tasks according to test strategies before marking as complete
- Mark completed tasks with `task-master set-status --id=<id> --status=done`
- Update dependent tasks when implementation differs from original plan
- Generate task files with `task-master generate` after updating tasks.json
- Maintain valid dependency structure with `task-master fix-dependencies` when needed
- Respect dependency chains and task priorities when selecting work
- Report progress regularly using the list command
