# Overview
The Visual Architecture Maintenance Tool is an AI-powered web application that enables enterprise architects and product owners to create, view, and update enterprise architectures using natural language. The system addresses the complexity of maintaining multi-layered enterprise architectures by automating change propagation across business, application, infrastructure, and implementation layers. It serves architects who need to design and make architectural decisions, as well as product owners who need to make financial and strategic decisions.

The tool eliminates the manual effort of updating architecture diagrams across multiple layers when changes occur, ensures consistency through automated validation, and provides real-time cost and impact analysis for architectural decisions.

# Core Features
## Natural Language Architecture Interface
- Chat-based interface for making architecture changes through conversational commands
- Supports three main interaction types: design (making changes), information (querying architecture), decision (comparing options)
- Context-aware processing that understands architectural terminology and relationships
- Multi-modal communication supporting both text and visual feedback

## Multi-Agent Architecture Processing
- Business Analyst Agent: Structures requirements using Subject-Action-Object format, creates project requirements documents
- Business Architect Agent: Processes strategic and business layer changes, accesses industry capability maps
- Application Architect Agent: Handles application layer updates, accesses reference architectures (AWS, Azure, Kubernetes, MLOps)
- Infrastructure Architect Agent: Manages infrastructure and DevOps changes, integrates cloud-native techniques
- Solution Architect Agent: Consolidates cross-layer changes, applies architectural patterns
- Project Manager Agent: Creates implementation work packages and manages dependencies
- Accountant Agent: Provides cost analysis and budget impact assessment
- Developer Agent: Generates actual code and infrastructure changes from user stories

## ArchiMate Visual Architecture Representation
- Standardized ArchiMate notation with specific color coding: Purple (#CC99FF) for strategy, Yellow (#FFFF99) for business, Light Brown (#E6CC99) for passive structures, Blue (#99CCFF) for application, Orange (#FFCC99) for implementation
- Embedded HTML architecture visualization in center pane showing all architecture aspects
- Change highlighting system: pending changes shown in gray, approved changes rendered in full color
- Multi-layer architecture visualization supporting business, application, infrastructure, and implementation views

## Change Management and Approval Workflow
- Automated change impact analysis across all architecture layers
- Preview system showing proposed changes before implementation
- User approval gates preventing unauthorized architecture modifications
- Change propagation engine that cascades updates through dependent layers
- Audit trail tracking all architecture modifications and approvals

## Architecture Repository and Persistence
- Git-based architecture storage with version control
- Architecture switching capability through hamburger menu navigation
- Persistent storage of architecture artifacts, change logs, and approval records
- Integration with reference architecture libraries and pattern catalogs

# User Experience
## User Personas

- Solution Architects: Technical specialists who focus on technology-specific implementation details
- Project Managers: Users who need implementation planning and work package organization

## Key User Flows
### Architecture Creation Flow
1. User selects "Create New Architecture" from hamburger menu
2. System prompts for architecture name, description, and optional template selection
3. User provides natural language description of system requirements
4. Business Analyst agent structures requirements and passes to other agents
5. Each agent contributes their layer-specific expertise in sequence
6. System presents complete architecture visualization for user review and approval

### Architecture Modification Flow
1. User types natural language change request in chat interface
2. System analyzes request type (design/information/decision) and routes to appropriate agents
3. Agents process changes and update their respective layers
4. System highlights proposed changes in gray on architecture visualization
5. User reviews changes and either approves or requests modifications
6. Upon approval, changes are implemented and visualization updated in full color

### Decision Support Flow
1. User requests comparison of architectural options through chat
2. System engages relevant agents to analyze current state and proposed alternatives
3. Agents provide layer-specific impact analysis, cost estimates, and risk assessments
4. System presents multiple architecture options on same visualization
5. User selects preferred option and system implements chosen architecture

## UI/UX Considerations
- Streamlit-based responsive web interface optimized for desktop and tablet use
- Three-pane layout: hamburger menu (left), architecture visualization (center), chat interface (bottom)
- Conversational UI design with context-aware responses and suggestions
- Visual feedback system with clear distinction between pending and approved changes

# Risks and Mitigations
## Technical Challenges
### Multi-Agent Coordination Complexity

- **Mitigation**: Implement robust workflow engine with clear handoff protocols, conflict resolution mechanisms, and rollback capabilities

### ArchiMate Visualization Performance
- **Risk**: Large, complex architectures may render slowly or become unresponsive
- **Mitigation**: Implement client-side rendering with incremental updates, lazy loading of architecture elements, and progressive disclosure

### Single Ingress Bottleneck
- **Risk**: All traffic routing through one Istio gateway may create performance bottleneck
- **Mitigation**: Configure Istio with proper load balancing, implement traffic management policies, and monitor gateway performance

## MVP Definition and Scope
### Agent Knowledge Consistency
- **Risk**: Different agents may have inconsistent understanding of architecture standards and patterns
- **Mitigation**: Implement centralized knowledge base with version control, regular agent knowledge synchronization, and validation checkpoints

### Change Approval Workflow Complexity

- **Mitigation**: Implement confidence scoring for NLP results, require user confirmation for significant changes, and provide clear change previews

## Resource and Infrastructure Constraints
