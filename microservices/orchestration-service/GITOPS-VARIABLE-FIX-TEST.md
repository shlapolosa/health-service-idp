# GitOps Variable Reference Fix Test

Final test for complete GitOps pipeline with corrected variable reference.

## Issue Fixed
- GitOps commit message had incorrect variable reference
- `detect-services` → `detect-changes` (correct reference)
- This was likely causing the GitOps job to fail

## Expected Final Results
✅ Phase 1: Security scanning (with vulnerability bypass)  
✅ Phase 2: Semantic versioning and Docker builds (working!)  
✅ **Phase 3: GitOps repository update (should now succeed!)**  
✅ Phase 4: Pipeline summary  

## Critical Moment
This should be the **complete end-to-end success** of the entire GitOps pipeline!

All components now fixed:
- ✅ Docker-compatible semantic versioning 
- ✅ Cross-repository authentication
- ✅ Vulnerability scan bypass
- ✅ Variable reference correction
