# GitHub Token Format Fix Test

Final authentication fix for GitOps push operations.

## Issue Identified and Fixed
- GitOps update was failing with 403 permission error on git push
- Git remote URL was using incorrect token format
- **Wrong**: `https://TOKEN@github.com/...`
- **Correct**: `https://x-access-token:TOKEN@github.com/...`

## Great Progress Already Made
✅ GitOps manifests were successfully updated locally  
✅ Files were modified and committed  
❌ Only git push failed due to authentication format  

## Expected Results
✅ Phase 1: Security scanning  
✅ Phase 2: Semantic versioning and Docker builds  
✅ **Phase 3: GitOps repository push (should now succeed!)**  
✅ Phase 4: Pipeline summary  

## The Final Authentication Fix
This uses the proper GitHub Personal Access Token authentication format.
