# Near Complete Success Test

Testing the 83% successful GitOps pipeline - final push to complete success.

## Current Status
✅ **Phase 1 - Security**: All components working (detect-changes, dependency-check, vulnerability-scan)  
✅ **Phase 2 - Build**: semantic-versioning and Docker builds fully operational  
❌ **Phase 3 - GitOps**: update-gitops step failing (last remaining issue)  
✅ **Phase 4 - Summary**: deployment-summary working  

## Major Achievements
- 🎯 5/6 jobs successful (83% success rate)
- 🐳 Docker builds with semantic versioning working perfectly
- 🔒 Security scanning operational for both services
- 📦 Container registry pushes successful

## Remaining Challenge
Final GitOps repository update - need to debug the specific failure in the update step.

## Test Objective
Validate current success and identify specific GitOps update failure for final resolution.
