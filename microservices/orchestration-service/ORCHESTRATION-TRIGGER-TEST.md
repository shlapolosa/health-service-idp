# Orchestration Service Trigger Test

Specifically triggering orchestration-service to test vulnerability scan build context.

## Test Strategy
- Make change to orchestration-service to trigger its inclusion
- Validate vulnerability scan build context fix for orchestration-service
- Monitor if both streamlit-frontend AND orchestration-service can build

## Build Context Logic to Test
```bash
if [[ "${{ matrix.service }}" == "orchestration-service" ]]; then
  BUILD_CONTEXT="./microservices"
  DOCKERFILE_PATH="-f orchestration-service/Dockerfile"
else
  BUILD_CONTEXT="./microservices/${{ matrix.service }}"
  DOCKERFILE_PATH=""
fi
```

## Expected Results
✅ Both streamlit-frontend and orchestration-service vulnerability scans succeed  
✅ semantic-versioning proceeds with both services  
✅ GitOps update completes successfully
