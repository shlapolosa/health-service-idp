# Personal Access Token Test

Testing complete GitOps pipeline with PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN for cross-repository access.

## Fix Applied
- ✅ PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN secret added to repository
- ✅ Workflow updated to use PAT for GitOps repository access
- ✅ Cross-repository authentication should now work

## Expected Complete Pipeline Results
✅ Phase 1: Security scanning (detect-changes, vulnerability-scan, dependency-check)  
✅ Phase 2: Semantic versioning and Docker builds (with major.minor.sha format)  
✅ **Phase 3: GitOps repository update (should now succeed!)**  
✅ Phase 4: Pipeline summary  

## Critical Test
This should be the **first complete end-to-end success** of the entire GitOps pipeline!
