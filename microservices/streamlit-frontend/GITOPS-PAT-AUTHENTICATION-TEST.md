# GitOps PAT Authentication Test

Testing GitOps update with proper PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN authentication for git push.

## Issue Fixed
- GitOps update was failing at git push step
- Git remote now configured to use PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
- Should resolve authentication issues for GitOps repository updates

## Authentication Flow
1. ✅ Repository checkout uses PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
2. ✅ Git remote URL configured with PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
3. ✅ Git push should now authenticate successfully

## Expected Complete Results
✅ Phase 1: Security scanning  
✅ Phase 2: Semantic versioning and Docker builds  
✅ **Phase 3: GitOps repository update (should now succeed!)**  
✅ Phase 4: Pipeline summary  

## Critical Fix
This addresses the final authentication barrier preventing complete GitOps pipeline success.
