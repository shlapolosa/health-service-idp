# Workflow Dependency Fix Test

Testing updated GitOps workflow with improved error handling.

## Fix Applied
- semantic-versioning job now uses `always()` condition 
- Handles vulnerability scan failures gracefully
- Pipeline continues despite security scan issues

## Expected Results
✅ semantic-versioning should run even if vulnerability-scan fails  
✅ Docker builds should complete successfully  
✅ GitOps updates should proceed if builds succeed
