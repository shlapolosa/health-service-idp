# GitOps Sed Pattern Fix Test

Final fix for GitOps manifest updates - corrected sed patterns for version fields.

## Issue Identified and Fixed
- GitOps update was failing due to incorrect sed patterns
- Workflow looked for `version: ".*"` (with quotes)
- Actual OAM files have `version: v1.0.0` (without quotes)
- Fixed all sed patterns to match actual file format

## Sed Pattern Corrections
- **Old**: `sed -i "s|version: \".*\"|version: \"$SEMVER\"|g"`  
- **New**: `sed -i "s|version: .*|version: $SEMVER|g"`

## Expected Complete Results
✅ Phase 1: Security scanning  
✅ Phase 2: Semantic versioning and Docker builds  
✅ **Phase 3: GitOps repository update (should now work!)**  
✅ Phase 4: Pipeline summary  

## The Final Fix
This addresses the manifest file pattern matching issue preventing GitOps updates.
