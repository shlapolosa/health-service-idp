# Orchestration Service Build Debug Test

Debugging the persistent orchestration-service vulnerability scan failure.

## Issue Analysis
- vulnerability-scan (orchestration-service) consistently failing
- Blocking semantic-versioning job from running
- Docker build context fix may not be working properly in vulnerability scan

## Possible Causes
1. Dockerfile path issue in vulnerability scan
2. Missing shared-libs in build context
3. Different behavior between vulnerability scan and semantic-versioning builds
4. Build environment differences

## Debug Strategy
- Test orchestration-service build specifically
- Validate Docker build context logic in vulnerability scan
- Compare with working semantic-versioning build approach

## Expected Debug Results
🔍 Identify specific orchestration-service build failure  
🔧 Apply targeted fix to vulnerability scan phase  
✅ Achieve consistent builds across all phases
