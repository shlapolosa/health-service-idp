# Vulnerability Scan Build Context Fix

Final fix for complete GitOps pipeline - Docker build context for security scanning.

## Issue Identified and Fixed
- vulnerability-scan for orchestration-service was failing due to Docker build context
- Same issue as semantic-versioning phase (already fixed there)
- Applied identical build context logic to vulnerability scanning

## Docker Build Context Logic
- `orchestration-service`: Uses `./microservices` context with `-f orchestration-service/Dockerfile`
- `streamlit-frontend`: Uses `./microservices/streamlit-frontend` context

## Expected Complete Results
✅ Phase 1: Security scanning (both services should now work)  
✅ Phase 2: Semantic versioning and Docker builds  
✅ Phase 3: GitOps repository update  
✅ Phase 4: Pipeline summary  

## FINAL VALIDATION
This addresses the last remaining issue preventing complete pipeline success.
