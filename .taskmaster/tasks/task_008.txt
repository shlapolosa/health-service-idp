# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Cloud Integration Services
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop integration services for cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) to enable cost analysis and deployment capabilities.
# Details:
1. Implement AWS integration using Boto3 1.26
2. Develop Azure integration using Azure SDK for Python 1.0
3. Create GCP integration using Google Cloud Client Library 2.9
4. Implement cost analysis and estimation features
5. Develop deployment planning and resource allocation logic
6. Create abstraction layer for multi-cloud operations
7. Integrate cloud services with agent orchestration system

Key Features:
- Cost estimation for architecture components
- Resource allocation planning
- Deployment strategy generation
- Multi-cloud comparison capabilities

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for individual cloud provider integrations
2. Integration tests with cloud provider sandboxes
3. Accuracy testing of cost estimation features
4. Validation of deployment planning logic
5. Performance testing of multi-cloud operations
6. Security testing of cloud credential management
7. End-to-end testing of cloud-integrated workflows
