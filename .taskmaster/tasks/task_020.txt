# Task ID: 20
# Title: Create Documentation and User Guide
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 15, 16, 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive documentation and user guide for the real-time platform components.
# Details:
Create documentation that explains how to use the realtime-platform component and the enhanced webservice component with realtime integration. Include examples of minimal and comprehensive configurations. Document all available parameters and their default values. Explain how to access the various services (Lenses HQ, MQTT, Metabase) and how to use the connection secrets. Create troubleshooting guides and operational runbooks. Document the architecture and data flow of the real-time platform.

# Test Strategy:
Review the documentation for accuracy and completeness. Test the examples provided in the documentation to ensure they work as described. Have other team members review the documentation and provide feedback.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Document Architecture and Component Overview [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation of the real-time platform architecture, data flow diagrams, and component relationships.
### Details:
Create a markdown document that includes: 1) High-level architecture diagram showing all components (Kafka, MQTT, Lenses HQ, Metabase, PostgreSQL), 2) Data flow diagrams showing how information moves through the system, 3) Component relationship diagrams showing dependencies, 4) Explanation of each component's purpose and role in the system, 5) System requirements and prerequisites. Include diagrams created with a tool like draw.io or mermaid and export them as SVG/PNG for inclusion in the documentation.

## 2. Create Configuration Reference Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Document all available configuration parameters for the realtime-platform and webservice components with realtime integration.
### Details:
Create a comprehensive reference document that: 1) Lists all configuration parameters for the realtime-platform component, 2) Documents all parameters for webservice components with realtime integration, 3) Specifies default values, data types, and validation rules for each parameter, 4) Organizes parameters by functional area (e.g., Kafka settings, MQTT settings, scaling, etc.), 5) Includes tables showing parameter interdependencies and constraints. Reference the existing component definitions in realtime-component-definitions.yaml and realtime-compositions.yaml to ensure all parameters are documented.

## 3. Develop Example-Based User Guide [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1, 20.2
### Description: Create a user guide with step-by-step instructions and examples for common usage scenarios.
### Details:
Develop a user guide that includes: 1) Step-by-step instructions for deploying the realtime-platform using the minimal example (MINIMAL-REALTIME-OAM.yaml), 2) Instructions for deploying the comprehensive example (REALTIME-OAM-EXAMPLE.yaml), 3) Walkthrough of customizing configurations for specific use cases, 4) Examples of integrating webservices with the realtime platform, 5) Screenshots and command outputs showing expected results at each step. Include code snippets that users can copy and adapt for their own implementations.

## 4. Create Service Access and Secrets Management Guide [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.2
### Description: Document how to access the various services (Lenses HQ, MQTT, Metabase) and manage connection secrets.
### Details:
Create documentation that: 1) Explains how to retrieve and use connection secrets for each service, 2) Provides instructions for accessing the web interfaces of Lenses HQ and Metabase, 3) Documents MQTT connection parameters and authentication methods, 4) Includes examples of connecting to each service using different client libraries and tools, 5) Explains how to rotate credentials and manage access control. Include specific code examples in multiple languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript) showing how to connect to each service.

## 5. Develop Troubleshooting Guide and Operational Runbooks [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1, 20.2, 20.3, 20.4
### Description: Create comprehensive troubleshooting guides and operational runbooks for maintaining the real-time platform.
### Details:
Develop documentation that includes: 1) Common error scenarios and their solutions, 2) Diagnostic procedures for identifying issues, 3) Operational runbooks for routine maintenance tasks, 4) Monitoring and alerting recommendations, 5) Backup and recovery procedures, 6) Scaling guidelines and performance optimization tips, 7) Upgrade and migration procedures. Organize the troubleshooting guide by component and symptom, with clear steps to diagnose and resolve each issue. Include command examples and expected outputs.
