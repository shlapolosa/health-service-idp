# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Streamlit Frontend Application
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the Streamlit-based web application with the required layout, navigation, and basic interaction components.
# Details:
1. Set up Streamlit 1.23 project structure
2. Implement three-pane layout (hamburger menu, visualization area, chat interface)
3. Create hamburger menu for architecture navigation and creation
4. Develop basic chat interface with message history
5. Implement session management and state handling
6. Set up WebSocket connection for real-time updates using websockets 11.0
7. Integrate with backend API using httpx 0.24
8. Implement responsive design for desktop and tablet use

Key Components:
- st.sidebar for hamburger menu
- st.columns for main layout
- st.chat_message for chat interface
- Custom HTML/JS component for architecture visualization (placeholder for now)

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for Streamlit components and layout
2. Integration tests with mock backend API
3. User acceptance testing for navigation and basic interactions
4. Cross-browser compatibility testing
5. Responsive design testing on various screen sizes
6. WebSocket connection and real-time update testing
7. Performance testing of UI rendering and state management

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Streamlit Project Structure and Basic Layout [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize the Streamlit project with the required directory structure and implement the three-pane layout with hamburger menu, visualization area, and chat interface.
### Details:
Create a new Streamlit project with appropriate directory structure (pages, components, utils, etc.). Implement the main layout using st.sidebar for the hamburger menu and st.columns for the visualization and chat areas. Set up basic CSS styling for the layout components. Create placeholder components for each section that will be enhanced in subsequent tasks.

## 2. Implement Hamburger Menu and Navigation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the hamburger menu in the sidebar with options for architecture navigation and creation. Implement the navigation logic between different sections of the application.
### Details:
Use st.sidebar to create the hamburger menu with expandable sections. Implement menu items for architecture selection, creation, and settings. Add appropriate icons and styling. Create the state management logic to handle navigation between different views based on user selection. Implement session state variables to track the current view and selected architecture.

## 3. Develop Chat Interface with Message History [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the chat interface component with support for displaying message history, user input, and different message types (user, assistant, system).
### Details:
Implement the chat interface using st.chat_message for displaying messages. Create a message input area with a send button. Implement functions to add messages to the chat history and display them with appropriate styling. Set up session state variables to store and persist chat history. Add support for different message types with distinct visual styling.

## 4. Implement Session Management and State Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop comprehensive session management and state handling to maintain application state across interactions and page refreshes.
### Details:
Implement session state management using Streamlit's session_state. Create functions to initialize, update, and retrieve session state variables. Implement state persistence for user preferences, selected architectures, and chat history. Add functionality to handle page refreshes and maintain state. Create utility functions for state management that can be used across the application.

## 5. Set up API Integration and WebSocket Connection [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement backend API integration using httpx and set up WebSocket connection for real-time updates.
### Details:
Create API client using httpx 0.24 to communicate with backend services. Implement functions for all required API endpoints (architecture retrieval, creation, updates, etc.). Set up WebSocket connection using websockets 11.0 for real-time updates. Implement connection management, reconnection logic, and message handling. Create a background task to listen for WebSocket messages and update the UI accordingly. Add error handling and retry logic for both API calls and WebSocket connections.
