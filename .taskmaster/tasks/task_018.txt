# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement Health Checks and Monitoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 8, 9, 10, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement health checks and monitoring for all components in the real-time platform.
# Details:
In the realtime-compositions.yaml file, implement health checks and monitoring for all components. Use the health check configurations provided in the PRD. Configure liveness and readiness probes for each component. Set up monitoring integration with the existing Prometheus/Grafana stack. Configure alerting for component failures. Implement log aggregation and monitoring.

# Test Strategy:
Deploy the Health Checks and Monitoring configuration and verify that all health checks are working correctly. Test the monitoring integration by checking that metrics are being collected in Prometheus and displayed in Grafana. Test alerting by simulating component failures.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure Health Check Endpoints for All Components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement health check endpoints for each component in the real-time platform, ensuring they expose appropriate liveness and readiness probes according to the PRD specifications.
### Details:
For each component in the realtime-compositions.yaml file (MQTT Broker, Kafka Cluster, PostgreSQL, Lenses Agent, etc.), add health check endpoint configurations. For the MQTT Broker, configure TCP socket checks on port 1883. For Kafka, implement HTTP checks on the JMX exporter endpoint. For PostgreSQL, use a simple database connection check. For Lenses components, use their built-in health endpoints. Configure both liveness probes (to detect if a component is running) and readiness probes (to detect if a component is ready to accept traffic) with appropriate initialDelaySeconds, periodSeconds, and failureThreshold values.

## 2. Set Up Prometheus Metrics Exporters [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Configure metrics exporters for all components to expose monitoring data to Prometheus in a standardized format.
### Details:
Add Prometheus annotations to each component's service definition to enable scraping. For Kafka, configure and expose the JMX exporter on port 9404. For PostgreSQL, deploy the postgres_exporter sidecar container. For MQTT Broker, add the mosquitto_exporter sidecar. For Lenses components, enable their built-in Prometheus metrics endpoints. Configure appropriate scrape intervals and metrics paths in the annotations. Ensure all exporters expose key performance metrics such as resource usage, request rates, error rates, and latency.

## 3. Implement Grafana Dashboards for Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.2
### Description: Create comprehensive Grafana dashboards to visualize the health and performance metrics of all platform components.
### Details:
Develop a set of Grafana dashboards that visualize the metrics collected by Prometheus. Create a main overview dashboard showing the health status of all components at a glance. Create component-specific dashboards for MQTT Broker, Kafka Cluster, PostgreSQL, and Lenses components with detailed metrics. Include panels for CPU/memory usage, connection counts, message throughput, error rates, and latency. Configure appropriate thresholds and color coding to highlight potential issues. Store dashboard definitions as code in the project repository.

## 4. Configure Alerting Rules and Notifications [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.2, 18.3
### Description: Set up alerting rules in Prometheus AlertManager to detect and notify about component failures and performance issues.
### Details:
Define Prometheus alerting rules for critical conditions such as component unavailability, high error rates, resource exhaustion, and performance degradation. Configure the AlertManager to route alerts to appropriate channels (email, Slack, PagerDuty) based on severity and component. Set up alert grouping and silencing policies to prevent alert storms. Define escalation paths for unresolved alerts. Create alert templates with actionable information including component details, error messages, and troubleshooting links. Store alerting configurations in the project repository alongside the component definitions.

## 5. Implement Log Aggregation and Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Set up centralized log collection, aggregation, and monitoring for all platform components.
### Details:
Configure each component to output logs in a structured format (JSON). Deploy a log collector (Fluentd or Fluent Bit) as a DaemonSet to collect logs from all pods. Configure the log collector to parse and enrich logs with metadata such as component name, namespace, and pod ID. Set up log forwarding to a centralized logging system (Elasticsearch or Loki). Create log indices and retention policies based on component types. Configure log-based alerts for critical error patterns. Integrate log visualization with Grafana dashboards created in subtask 18.3. Ensure sensitive information is properly masked in logs.
