# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Change Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the change management and approval workflow system for architecture modifications.
# Details:
1. Design change request data model and workflow states
2. Implement change request creation and tracking API
3. Develop approval workflow with role-based permissions
4. Create change propagation logic across architecture layers
5. Implement change preview system
6. Develop audit trail and versioning capabilities
7. Integrate change management with agent orchestration system

Key Technologies:
- FastAPI for API endpoints
- SQLAlchemy for ORM and database interactions
- Pydantic for data validation
- Alembic for database migrations
- Pytest for testing

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for change request model and state transitions
2. Integration tests for approval workflows
3. Authorization and role-based access control testing
4. Validation of change propagation across layers
5. Performance testing of change preview generation
6. Audit trail and versioning system validation
7. End-to-end testing of change management process

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Change Management Data Model [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive data model for the Change Management System
### Details:
Design database schema including tables for change requests, approval workflows, state transitions, and versioning. Define entity relationships between changes, affected components, approvers, and audit logs. Include fields for change type, priority, impact assessment, rollback plan, and implementation timeline. Specify constraints, indexes, and optimization strategies for query performance.

## 2. Implement Workflow State Management [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the state machine for change request lifecycle management
### Details:
Create a state transition engine that handles the complete lifecycle of change requests (Draft, Submitted, In Review, Approved, Rejected, Implemented, Rolled Back). Implement validation rules for state transitions based on role permissions. Design API endpoints for state transitions with appropriate authentication and authorization checks. Include notification triggers for state changes and SLA monitoring for time-sensitive states.

## 3. Build Approval Process Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Develop the multi-level approval workflow system with role-based permissions
### Details:
Implement approval chains with configurable approval levels based on change type and impact. Create delegation mechanisms for approvals during absence. Design approval queues with prioritization logic. Develop API endpoints for approval actions (approve, reject, request more information). Implement conditional approval paths based on change attributes and organizational hierarchy.

## 4. Develop Change Propagation and Preview System [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Create the logic for propagating changes across system components with preview capabilities
### Details:
Implement change propagation algorithms to identify all affected components. Develop a sandbox environment for change previews before implementation. Create diff visualization tools for comparing before/after states. Build integration points with the agent orchestration system for executing changes. Implement rollback mechanisms for failed changes with state preservation.

## 5. Implement Audit and Versioning Capabilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.4
### Description: Build comprehensive audit trails and versioning system for all changes
### Details:
Develop immutable audit logging for all change-related actions with user attribution. Implement version control for configuration changes with diff capabilities. Create reporting APIs for compliance and governance requirements. Design archiving strategies for historical change data. Build dashboards for change analytics and trend visualization. Implement search capabilities across the audit history with filtering options.
