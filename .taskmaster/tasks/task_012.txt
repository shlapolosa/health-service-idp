# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Stream Processing Queries
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Configure the Lenses SQL queries for data decomposition and topic routing.
# Details:
In the realtime-compositions.yaml file, implement the configuration for the Lenses SQL queries that transform data from the device_data topic to specialized topics (blood_pressure_device_topic, heart_rate_device_topic, oxygen_saturation_device_topic, temperature_device_topic). Use the SQL query templates provided in the PRD. Configure the queries to use the appropriate Avro schemas and key formats. Ensure the queries are deployed and managed by the Lenses Agent.

# Test Strategy:
Deploy the Stream Processing Queries configuration and verify that the queries are created correctly. Test the queries by publishing messages to the device_data topic and verifying that they are transformed and routed to the specialized topics. Verify that the Avro schemas are applied correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create realtime-compositions.yaml file structure for Lenses SQL queries [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the basic structure in the realtime-compositions.yaml file for implementing the Lenses SQL queries configuration. This includes defining the necessary sections for stream processing and establishing the connection to the device_data topic.
### Details:
Create or update the realtime-compositions.yaml file with a dedicated section for Lenses SQL queries. Define the configuration structure that will contain the four transformation queries. Include the connection parameters to the Kafka cluster and ensure the device_data topic is properly referenced as the source. Set up the basic configuration that will be common across all queries, such as error handling and processing guarantees.

## 2. Implement blood pressure and heart rate transformation queries [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Configure the first two SQL queries that transform data from the device_data topic to the blood_pressure_device_topic and heart_rate_device_topic, following the templates from the PRD.
### Details:
Implement the SQL queries for blood pressure and heart rate data transformation. For the blood pressure query, extract systolic and diastolic readings from the device_data topic and route them to blood_pressure_device_topic. For the heart rate query, extract pulse rate measurements and route them to heart_rate_device_topic. Configure both queries to use the appropriate Avro schemas for the output topics and set the correct key formats based on patient and device identifiers. Include proper error handling and data validation in the queries.

## 3. Implement oxygen saturation and temperature transformation queries [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Configure the remaining two SQL queries that transform data from the device_data topic to the oxygen_saturation_device_topic and temperature_device_topic, following the templates from the PRD.
### Details:
Implement the SQL queries for oxygen saturation and temperature data transformation. For the oxygen saturation query, extract SpO2 readings from the device_data topic and route them to oxygen_saturation_device_topic. For the temperature query, extract temperature measurements and route them to temperature_device_topic. Configure both queries to use the appropriate Avro schemas for the output topics and set the correct key formats based on patient and device identifiers. Include proper error handling and data validation in the queries.

## 4. Configure Lenses Agent integration for query deployment [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2, 12.3
### Description: Set up the configuration to ensure the Lenses Agent properly deploys and manages the SQL queries. This includes specifying deployment parameters, resource allocation, and monitoring settings.
### Details:
Configure the Lenses Agent integration for the SQL queries by specifying the deployment parameters such as parallelism, checkpoint intervals, and state store configuration. Set appropriate resource allocation (CPU, memory) for each query based on expected throughput. Configure monitoring and alerting for the queries, including metrics collection and error reporting. Ensure the queries are automatically deployed when the Lenses Agent starts and that they can be updated without service interruption.

## 5. Implement error handling and validation for all queries [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2, 12.3, 12.4
### Description: Enhance all SQL queries with comprehensive error handling, data validation, and logging to ensure robust operation in production.
### Details:
Implement error handling for all queries to manage scenarios such as malformed input data, schema evolution, and downstream connectivity issues. Add data validation logic to ensure only valid measurements are processed and routed. Configure dead-letter queues for messages that fail processing. Implement detailed logging for query execution, including processing rates, latency metrics, and error counts. Set up alerting thresholds for critical error conditions. Ensure all queries have consistent error handling patterns and logging formats.
