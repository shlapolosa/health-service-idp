# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement ArchiMate Visualization Component
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the HTML/JavaScript component for rendering ArchiMate-compliant architecture visualizations with interactive features.
# Details:
1. Research and select appropriate visualization library (e.g., D3.js 7.8 or Cytoscape.js 3.25)
2. Implement ArchiMate 3.2 notation standards and color coding
3. Develop rendering logic for multi-layer architecture visualization
4. Implement interactive features: zoom, pan, and layer switching
5. Create change highlighting system (gray for pending, color for approved)
6. Optimize rendering performance for large architectures
7. Integrate visualization component with Streamlit frontend

Key Technologies:
- D3.js or Cytoscape.js for visualization
- TypeScript 5.1 for type-safe JavaScript
- WebAssembly (WASM) for performance-critical rendering logic
- Web Workers for offloading heavy computations

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for rendering logic and ArchiMate compliance
2. Visual regression testing for consistent rendering
3. Performance testing with large architecture datasets
4. User acceptance testing for interactive features
5. Cross-browser compatibility testing
6. Accessibility testing (keyboard navigation, screen reader support)
7. Integration testing with Streamlit and backend data flow

# Subtasks:
## 1. Visualization Library Selection and Evaluation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Research, evaluate, and select the most appropriate visualization library for implementing ArchiMate diagrams in Streamlit.
### Details:
Compare libraries like D3.js, Cytoscape.js, vis.js, and GoJS based on: rendering performance with 500+ elements, ArchiMate symbol support, layout algorithms, interactive capabilities, Streamlit compatibility, and licensing. Create a comparison matrix with benchmarks for each option. Develop small proof-of-concept implementations with each viable library to test integration with Streamlit. Document findings and justify final selection.

## 2. ArchiMate Notation Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the complete ArchiMate 3.1 notation system using the selected visualization library.
### Details:
Create visual representations for all ArchiMate 3.1 elements (Business, Application, Technology, Physical, Strategy, Implementation & Migration layers). Implement relationship types (structural, dependency, dynamic, other). Design a consistent visual styling system following ArchiMate specifications. Ensure proper element sizing, spacing, and relationship routing. Create a comprehensive test suite with examples of each element and relationship type. Document the implementation approach and any deviations from standard notation.

## 3. Interactive Features Development [done]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Develop interactive capabilities for the ArchiMate visualization component.
### Details:
Implement zoom and pan functionality with smooth transitions. Create element selection and highlighting features. Add tooltips showing detailed element information on hover. Develop filtering capabilities by layer, element type, and relationships. Implement collapsible/expandable element groups. Add search functionality to locate elements by name or properties. Create interactive layout controls (force-directed, hierarchical, circular). Ensure all interactions work with both mouse and keyboard for accessibility. Implement undo/redo functionality for user actions.

## 4. Performance Optimization [done]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Optimize the visualization component for handling large ArchiMate models efficiently.
### Details:
Implement level-of-detail rendering based on zoom level. Create efficient data structures for quick element lookup and relationship traversal. Optimize rendering through element virtualization (only render visible elements). Implement incremental rendering for large diagrams. Add caching mechanisms for layout calculations. Conduct performance testing with models of varying sizes (100, 500, 1000+ elements). Optimize memory usage to prevent leaks during long sessions. Document performance benchmarks and optimization techniques applied.

## 5. Streamlit Integration and Final Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 6.4
### Description: Integrate the ArchiMate visualization component with Streamlit and finalize the implementation.
### Details:
Create Streamlit-compatible component wrapper for the visualization. Implement bidirectional communication between Streamlit and the visualization component. Develop configuration controls in Streamlit UI for visualization settings. Create export functionality for diagrams (PNG, SVG, PDF). Implement state persistence to maintain visualization state between Streamlit reruns. Add responsive design to adapt to different screen sizes. Conduct cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). Create comprehensive documentation including usage examples, API reference, and customization options. Perform final accessibility testing (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance).
