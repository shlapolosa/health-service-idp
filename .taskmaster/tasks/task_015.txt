# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Secret Generation and Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 8, 9, 10, 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the generation and management of connection secrets for all components in the real-time platform.
# Details:
In the realtime-compositions.yaml file, implement the logic for generating and managing connection secrets for all components. Create standardized secret names following the {name}-{service}-secret pattern. Include all necessary connection details (host, port, database, user, password) for each service. Configure the secrets to be exposed in the RealtimePlatformClaim status. Implement integration with External Secrets Operator for Snowflake credentials if the snowflake parameter is enabled.

# Test Strategy:
Deploy the Secret Generation and Management logic and verify that all secrets are created correctly. Test that the secrets contain the correct connection details. Verify that the secrets are exposed in the RealtimePlatformClaim status. Test the integration with External Secrets Operator if applicable.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Secret Naming Convention and Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish a standardized naming convention and structure for all connection secrets in the real-time platform following the {name}-{service}-secret pattern. Define the required fields for each type of service (PostgreSQL, Kafka, MQTT, etc.).
### Details:
In the realtime-compositions.yaml file, create a helper function that generates secret names consistently. Define templates for different service types with all necessary connection fields: PostgreSQL (host, port, database, user, password), Kafka (bootstrap servers, schema registry URL), MQTT (broker URL, credentials), etc. Document the naming convention and field structure in comments.

## 2. Implement Secret Generation for Database Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Implement the generation of connection secrets for PostgreSQL database components, ensuring they contain all necessary connection details.
### Details:
In the realtime-compositions.yaml file, implement the logic to generate secrets for PostgreSQL database components. Extract connection details (host, port, database, user, password) from the PostgreSQL component definition. Create Kubernetes Secret resources with these details using the standardized naming pattern. Ensure the secrets are properly labeled and annotated for discovery.

## 3. Implement Secret Generation for Messaging Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Implement the generation of connection secrets for Kafka and MQTT broker components, ensuring they contain all necessary connection details.
### Details:
In the realtime-compositions.yaml file, implement the logic to generate secrets for Kafka and MQTT components. For Kafka, include bootstrap servers, schema registry URL, and any authentication details. For MQTT, include broker URL, ports (1883 for MQTT, 9001 for WebSockets), and authentication credentials. Create Kubernetes Secret resources with these details using the standardized naming pattern.

## 4. Expose Secrets in RealtimePlatformClaim Status [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2, 15.3
### Description: Configure the generated secrets to be exposed in the RealtimePlatformClaim status to make them discoverable by applications.
### Details:
Modify the RealtimePlatformClaim controller to collect all generated secrets and expose their names in the status field. Create a structured format in the status that organizes secrets by service type (database, messaging, etc.). Include secret names, service types, and optionally non-sensitive connection details like hostnames and ports. Ensure sensitive information like passwords is not exposed in the status.

## 5. Implement External Secrets Operator Integration for Snowflake [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Implement integration with External Secrets Operator to manage Snowflake credentials when the snowflake parameter is enabled.
### Details:
In the realtime-compositions.yaml file, add conditional logic that checks if the snowflake parameter is enabled. If enabled, create an ExternalSecret resource that references Snowflake credentials stored in an external secrets manager. Configure the ExternalSecret to create a Kubernetes Secret with the standardized naming pattern. Include all necessary Snowflake connection details (account, username, password, role, warehouse, database). Ensure the secret is properly labeled and annotated for discovery.
