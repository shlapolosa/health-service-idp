# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Agent Orchestration System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the core agent orchestration service to manage workflow between specialized agents and handle event-driven communication.
# Details:
1. Design agent orchestration architecture using Python 3.11
2. Implement workflow engine with configurable agent sequences
3. Develop event-driven messaging system using Redis Streams
4. Create agent registration and discovery mechanisms
5. Implement error handling and retry logic for agent failures
6. Develop monitoring and logging system for agent activities
7. Implement agent scaling based on workload using Knative

Key Technologies:
- FastAPI for API endpoints
- Redis Streams for event-driven messaging
- Pydantic 2.0 for data validation
- Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring
- OpenTelemetry 1.18 for distributed tracing

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for workflow engine and agent communication
2. Integration tests for end-to-end agent workflows
3. Stress testing of message queue and event handling
4. Fault injection testing for error handling and recovery
5. Performance testing of agent scaling
6. Monitoring and alerting system validation
7. End-to-end tracing of multi-agent workflows

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Workflow Engine Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a detailed architecture design for the workflow engine that will orchestrate agent interactions
### Details:
Develop a comprehensive architecture document that includes: workflow state management, transition rules, parallel execution capabilities, conditional branching logic, and workflow persistence. Define interfaces for workflow definition, execution, and monitoring. Include sequence diagrams for key workflows and component interaction diagrams. Specify data models for workflow definitions, instances, and execution history. Consider scalability requirements to handle at least 1000 concurrent workflow executions.

## 2. Implement Redis Streams Event Bus [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the event-driven messaging system using Redis Streams for agent communication
### Details:
Create a robust event bus implementation using Redis Streams with the following features: message serialization/deserialization with schema validation, consumer group management for load balancing, automatic reconnection and error recovery, backpressure handling, and dead letter queues for failed messages. Implement both synchronous and asynchronous messaging patterns. Include comprehensive logging and metrics collection. Develop unit tests that verify message delivery guarantees, ordering, and fault tolerance under various failure scenarios.

## 3. Build Agent Registration and Discovery System [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Create a system for agents to register capabilities and for the orchestrator to discover available agents
### Details:
Implement a registration system where agents can advertise their capabilities, resource requirements, and constraints. Develop a discovery mechanism that allows the orchestrator to find appropriate agents for specific tasks based on capability matching. Include health checking and automatic deregistration of failed agents. Design and implement a capability description language for precise matching. Create a persistent store for agent information with caching for performance. Implement versioning for agent capabilities to handle upgrades and compatibility.

## 4. Develop Comprehensive Error Handling Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.3
### Description: Implement robust error handling, retry mechanisms, and failure recovery for the orchestration system
### Details:
Design and implement a multi-layered error handling framework including: categorization of errors (transient vs. permanent), configurable retry policies with exponential backoff, circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascading failures, fallback mechanisms for degraded operation, and transaction compensation for partial workflow failures. Implement detailed error logging with contextual information. Create a test suite that simulates various failure scenarios including network partitions, agent crashes, and resource exhaustion. Ensure all error paths are properly documented.

## 5. Integrate OpenTelemetry Monitoring and Observability [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.3, 4.4
### Description: Implement comprehensive monitoring, tracing, and observability using OpenTelemetry
### Details:
Integrate OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing across all system components. Implement custom metrics for workflow execution times, error rates, agent utilization, and message queue depths. Create dashboards for system health monitoring with alerting for anomalies. Implement trace context propagation across service boundaries. Develop structured logging that correlates with trace IDs. Create performance tests to establish baseline metrics and detect regressions. Document all observability touchpoints and provide runbooks for common operational scenarios.
