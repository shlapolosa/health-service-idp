# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Snowflake Sink Connector Configuration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10, 12
# Priority: low
# Description: Configure the Snowflake Sink Connector that sends processed data to Snowflake for analytics.
# Details:
In the realtime-compositions.yaml file, implement the configuration for the Snowflake Sink Connector. Configure the connector with the appropriate settings for connecting to Snowflake (snowflake_url_name, snowflake_user_name, snowflake_database_name, snowflake_schema_name) and mapping Kafka topics to Snowflake tables. Set up authentication using the credentials from the snowflake parameter. Configure buffer settings and Avro conversion. Ensure the connector is deployed and managed by the Lenses Agent. Make this component conditional based on the snowflake.enabled parameter.

# Test Strategy:
Deploy the Snowflake Sink Connector configuration and verify that it is created correctly. Test the connector by publishing messages to the Kafka topics and verifying that they appear in Snowflake tables. Test error handling and buffer settings.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Snowflake Sink Connector Base Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the basic configuration structure for the Snowflake Sink Connector in the realtime-compositions.yaml file, including component name, image, and conditional deployment based on snowflake.enabled parameter.
### Details:
Add a new component to realtime-compositions.yaml with name 'snowflake-sink-connector'. Use the Kafka Connect framework with the Snowflake connector plugin. Make the component conditional by adding a condition that checks if snowflake.enabled is true. Include basic deployment configuration with resource limits and requests. Set up the component to be managed by the Lenses Agent.

## 2. Configure Snowflake Connection Parameters [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Set up the connection parameters for Snowflake, including URL, user, database, schema, and authentication credentials from the snowflake parameter.
### Details:
Configure environment variables or connector properties for Snowflake connection: SNOWFLAKE_URL_NAME, SNOWFLAKE_USER_NAME, SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE_NAME, and SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA_NAME. Set up authentication using credentials from the snowflake parameter, referencing them as secrets. Include proper error handling for connection failures and implement retry logic.

## 3. Implement Kafka Topic to Snowflake Table Mapping [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2
### Description: Configure the mapping between Kafka topics and Snowflake tables, including topic patterns, table naming conventions, and schema handling.
### Details:
Define the topics to be consumed by the connector using either specific topic names or patterns. Configure the table naming strategy to map Kafka topics to Snowflake tables (e.g., using the same name or a prefix/suffix). Set up schema handling to ensure that Kafka message schemas are properly translated to Snowflake table schemas. Configure the connector to handle schema evolution appropriately.

## 4. Configure Buffer Settings and Data Conversion [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.3
### Description: Set up buffer settings for the connector to handle data flow efficiently and configure Avro conversion for data serialization.
### Details:
Configure buffer settings including batch size, flush interval, and retry parameters to optimize performance and reliability. Set up Avro conversion for data serialization, ensuring compatibility with the Kafka Schema Registry. Configure error handling for data conversion issues. Set appropriate buffer limits to prevent memory issues during high load.

## 5. Implement Monitoring and Integration with Lenses Agent [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.4
### Description: Configure monitoring for the Snowflake Sink Connector and ensure proper integration with the Lenses Agent for management and observability.
### Details:
Set up JMX metrics for the connector to monitor performance and health. Configure logging with appropriate levels for troubleshooting. Ensure the connector is properly registered with the Lenses Agent for management. Set up health checks to monitor the connector's status. Configure alerts for critical issues such as connection failures or data processing errors.
