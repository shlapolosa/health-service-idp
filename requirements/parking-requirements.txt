# **Parking System Requirements Document**

## **1. Introduction**

This document outlines the requirements for a smart parking management system that uses **real-time monitoring of parking spaces**, supports **multi-channel chat-based customer interaction**, and includes **workflow processes for onboarding clients (parking lot operators, fleet owners, and end-users)**.

The system aims to optimize parking space utilization, improve user experience, and streamline operations for administrators and partners.

---

## **2. System Overview**

The system will:

* Use **IoT sensors / computer vision** to detect space availability in real-time.
* Provide **mobile and web applications** for customers and admins.
* Support **multi-channel chat** (e.g., WhatsApp, Telegram, website live chat, Facebook Messenger, in-app chat) for user queries, reservations, and support.
* Include **workflow automation** for onboarding new parking locations, operators, and users.
* Offer analytics and reporting for occupancy, revenue, and operational efficiency.

---

## **3. Functional Requirements**

### **3.1 Real-Time Parking Space Monitoring**

* **FR-1**: Detect and update parking space occupancy every 2–5 seconds.
* **FR-2**: Support both **fixed parking lots** and **multi-level parking structures**.
* **FR-3**: Store historical occupancy data for analytics.
* **FR-4**: Trigger alerts when occupancy exceeds configurable thresholds.

---

### **3.2 Multi-Channel Chat Interface**

* **FR-5**: Integrate with at least three channels at launch (e.g., WhatsApp, web chat, mobile app chat).
* **FR-6**: Allow customers to:

  * Check space availability.
  * Reserve a space.
  * Request parking lot navigation assistance.
  * Get pricing and operating hours.
* **FR-7**: Support **NLP-based chatbot** for automated responses.
* **FR-8**: Escalate conversations to human support agents when necessary.
* **FR-9**: Log chat history in the customer profile.

---

### **3.3 Reservation and Payment**

* **FR-10**: Allow customers to reserve spaces via app or chat.
* **FR-11**: Support multiple payment options (credit card, mobile wallets, prepaid accounts).
* **FR-12**: Provide dynamic pricing based on demand, time of day, or special events.
* **FR-13**: Send confirmation and reminders via chat and email.

---

### **3.4 Onboarding Workflows**

* **FR-14**: Operator Onboarding:

  * Submit parking lot details (location, capacity, pricing rules).
  * Provide required compliance documents.
  * System verification and approval workflow.
* **FR-15**: User Onboarding:

  * Registration via app/web/social login.
  * Vehicle registration (plate number, type, color).
  * Optional linking of payment methods.
* **FR-16**: Support step-by-step onboarding guidance with automated notifications.
* **FR-17**: Allow admins to track onboarding progress and flag pending actions.

---

### **3.5 Admin Dashboard**

* **FR-18**: Display real-time occupancy map.
* **FR-19**: Show historical trends, revenue data, and customer activity.
* **FR-20**: Manage chat conversations and assign to agents.
* **FR-21**: Configure parking lot settings (rates, hours, reserved spots).
* **FR-22**: Access audit logs for compliance.

---

## **4. Non-Functional Requirements**

* **NFR-1**: Availability – 99.9% uptime SLA.
* **NFR-2**: Scalability – Must support up to 50,000 concurrent users at launch.
* **NFR-3**: Response Time – Occupancy updates must be displayed within 2 seconds of detection.
* **NFR-4**: Security – Must comply with ISO 27001 and GDPR standards.
* **NFR-5**: Integration – Open API for third-party apps and city-wide parking aggregation systems.

---

## **5. System Integrations**

* **IoT Layer** – Parking space sensors (e.g., LoRaWAN, NB-IoT) or CCTV with AI vision models.
* **Chat Layer** – WhatsApp Business API, Telegram Bot API, web chat widget, in-app chat SDK.
* **Payment Gateways** – Stripe, PayPal, local mobile payment APIs.
* **Map Services** – Google Maps / OpenStreetMap for navigation.

## **7. Reporting and Analytics**

* Occupancy rate by hour/day/month.
* Peak usage times and demand forecasting.
* Revenue by lot, operator, and channel.
* Chatbot resolution vs. human escalation rates.
