# 📄 **Business Requirements Document (BRD)**

## Smart Parking Meter System with Intelligent Sensors

---

### 📌 **1. Executive Summary**

The Smart Parking Meter System aims to modernize urban parking by using intelligent sensors to detect occupied bays, offering real-time availability and cost information through chat and dashboards. The system also includes an admin frontend for managing parking lots. This will reduce congestion, improve user convenience, and streamline parking management.

---

### 🎯 **2. Business Objectives**

* Optimize utilization of parking space through real-time availability.
* Improve user experience via chat-based assistance.
* Provide transparent, updated parking costs across locations.
* Centralize parking lot administration with a web-based interface.

### 🧰 **4. Functional Requirements**

#### 4.1 **Sensor-Based Bay Detection**

* Each parking bay must have a sensor to detect presence/absence of a vehicle.
* System updates occupancy status in real-time.
* Sensor status must be queryable via API or internal service.

#### 4.2 **Real-time Availability Query**

* System must track number of available bays per floor, per lot.
* Data must update dynamically and be accessible via:

  * Chat interface
  * Mobile/web user dashboard

#### 4.3 **Chat Interface for Users**

* Users can ask via chat:

  * "Which floor has available space at Lot X?"
  * "Where can I find parking near \[location]?"
  * "How much does parking cost at \[lot name]?"
* Chat must respond with:

  * Location
  * Floor-level availability
  * Pricing information
  * Navigation link (optional)

#### 4.4 **Parking Lot Directory**

* View all parking lots in the system via UI or chat.
* Each lot includes:

  * Name
  * Location (map pin & address)
  * Operating hours
  * Available bays
  * Cost per hour/day
  * Accessibility features (e.g., EV charging, disabled bays)

#### 4.5 **Admin Frontend**

Admins should be able to:

* **Add / Remove / Update parking lots**

  * Lot name, location, floors, pricing, capacity
* **Monitor sensor status**

  * See faulty or inactive sensors
* **Override availability manually**

  * For maintenance or events
* **Generate reports**

  * Usage per day, revenue, peak hours
* **Set pricing rules**

  * Different pricing for weekdays, weekends, peak hours

| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Availability    | System must be operational 99.9% of the time                  |
| Scalability     | Must support up to 1000 parking lots and 100,000 bays         |
| Performance     | Chat responses < 2 seconds, sensor updates < 5 seconds        |
| Security        | Secure admin login with MFA; encrypted user data              |
| Localization    | System must support multiple cities/languages                 |
