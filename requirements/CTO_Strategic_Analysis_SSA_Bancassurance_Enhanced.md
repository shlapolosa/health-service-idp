## 2. Architecture Strategy & Technology Decisions

### 2.1 Platform Architecture Philosophy

**Decision: Cloud-Native, API-First, Event-Driven Microservices**

```yaml
architectural_principles:
  scalability_first: "Design for 10M+ users from day one"
  offline_native: "Offline capabilities as first-class features"
  cultural_intelligence: "Localization embedded at architecture level"
  security_by_design: "Zero-trust security from infrastructure up"
  compliance_ready: "Multi-jurisdiction compliance built-in"
```

**Rationale**: This architecture enables rapid scaling across diverse African markets while maintaining performance on low-end devices and unstable networks.

### 2.2 Technology Stack Strategic Decisions

#### Frontend Strategy: Progressive Web App + SDK Ecosystem

**Primary Decision: React-based PWA with Native SDK Bridge**

```typescript
// Strategic Technology Stack
const technologyDecisions = {
  frontend: {
    primary: "React 18 + Next.js 14 PWA",
    mobile_sdk: "React Native 0.72+ for bank integration", 
    ui_framework: "Custom design system built on Radix UI",
    performance: "Service Workers + IndexedDB + WebAssembly",
    rationale: "90% code reuse across platforms, offline-first capabilities"
  },
  
  backend: {
    api_layer: "Node.js/TypeScript + Fastify",
    microservices: "Domain-driven design with 18 core services",
    database_strategy: "PostgreSQL + MongoDB + Redis cluster",
    messaging: "Apache Kafka for event streaming",
    rationale: "JavaScript ecosystem enables rapid development, strong African dev talent pool"
  },
  
  ai_ml_stack: {
    document_processing: "Google Cloud Vision + custom OCR models",
    fraud_detection: "TensorFlow + Apache Spark MLlib", 
    personalization: "Apache Mahout + real-time recommendations",
    cultural_adaptation: "OpenAI GPT-4 + fine-tuned local language models",
    rationale: "Hybrid cloud/edge deployment for data sovereignty"
  }
}
```

**Alternative Considered**: Java Spring Boot + Angular
**Decision Against**: Slower development velocity, limited African Java talent pool

#### Data Architecture: Event-Driven Data Mesh

**Strategic Decision: Event Sourcing + CQRS Pattern**

```yaml
data_strategy:
  pattern: "Event Sourcing with Command Query Responsibility Segregation"
  benefits:

  banking_systems:
    pattern: "Anti-corruption layer with standardized adapters"
    protocols: ["REST APIs", "GraphQL", "Message Queues", "SOAP (legacy)"]
    auth: "OAuth 2.0 + OpenID Connect + SAML 2.0"
    
  mobile_money:
    providers: 
      west_africa: ["MTN MoMo", "Orange Money", "Airtel Money", "Vodafone Cash"]
      east_africa: ["M-Pesa", "Airtel Money", "Tigocash", "Halopesa"] 
      southern_africa: ["EcoCash", "MTN MoMo", "Airtel Money"]
    abstraction: "Common payment interface with provider-specific adapters"
