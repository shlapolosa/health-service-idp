**Date**: 2025-01-27T19:15
**Analyst**: Chief Technology Officer
**Project**: Real-time Monitored Parking System
**Platform**: OAM-based Cloud-Native Infrastructure

## Executive Summary

The smart parking platform represents a classic IoT-to-customer application requiring real-time data processing, multi-channel customer engagement, and robust payment processing.
