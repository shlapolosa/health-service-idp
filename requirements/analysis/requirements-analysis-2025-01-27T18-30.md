## Executive Summary
The parking requirements describe a comprehensive smart parking management system with real-time monitoring, multi-channel chat support, and automated onboarding workflows. The system addresses the core business problem of parking space optimization while providing superior user experience through modern communication channels.

## Key Business Requirements Extracted

### Primary Business Objectives
1. **Space Utilization Optimization**: Use IoT sensors/computer vision to maximize parking efficiency
2. **Multi-Channel Customer Engagement**: Support WhatsApp, Telegram, web chat, Facebook Messenger, and in-app chat
3. **Automated Onboarding**: Streamline operator and user registration processes
4. **Revenue Generation**: Dynamic pricing with multiple payment options
5. **Operational Excellence**: Admin dashboard with analytics and reporting

### Functional Requirements Analysis
- **Real-time Monitoring**: 2-5 second update frequency for space occupancy
- **Multi-level Support**: Both fixed lots and multi-level parking structures
- **NLP Chatbot**: Automated responses with human escalation capability
- **Reservation System**: Space booking via app or chat interfaces
- **Payment Integration**: Credit cards, mobile wallets, prepaid accounts
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Demand-based, time-based, and event-based pricing

### Non-Functional Requirements Analysis
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime SLA (8.76 hours downtime/year max)
- **Scalability**: 50,000 concurrent users at launch
- **Performance**: 2-second response time for occupancy updates
- **Security**: ISO 27001 and GDPR compliance required
- **Integration**: Open API for third-party systems

### Stakeholder Analysis
1. **Parking Lot Operators**: Need onboarding, compliance verification, revenue tracking
2. **End Users**: Need space finding, reservation, payment, navigation assistance
3. **System Administrators**: Need dashboards, analytics, chat management
4. **Third-party Integrators**: Need API access for city-wide parking systems

### Integration Points Identified
- IoT sensors (LoRaWAN, NB-IoT) or CCTV with AI vision
- Chat platforms (WhatsApp Business API, Telegram Bot API, web widgets)
- Payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal, local mobile payments)
- Mapping services (Google Maps, OpenStreetMap)

## Key Assumptions
1. Parking operators willing to install IoT sensors or camera systems
2. Users comfortable with chat-based interactions for parking services
3. Regulatory approval available for smart parking implementations
4. Reliable internet connectivity at parking locations
5. Integration APIs available for chosen chat platforms and payment gateways

## Identified Constraints
1. Real-time performance requirements may limit technology choices
2. Multi-channel chat complexity increases integration overhead
3. GDPR/ISO 27001 compliance adds security architecture requirements
4. 50,000 concurrent user requirement needs significant infrastructure planning
5. 99.9% uptime SLA requires redundancy and disaster recovery planning
