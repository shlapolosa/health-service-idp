**Date**: 2025-01-27T18:35
**Assessor**: Compliance & Risk Assessment Specialist
**Project**: Real-time Monitored Parking System

## Executive Summary

The smart parking system presents moderate compliance complexity due to PII handling, payment processing, location tracking, and IoT data collection. Key regulatory areas include data protection (GDPR/CCPA), payment security (PCI-DSS), and municipal regulations for smart city infrastructure. The 99.9% uptime SLA and 50,000 concurrent user requirement create additional operational risk considerations.

## Compliance Requirements

### Regulatory Landscape

**Primary Regulations:**
- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**: Vehicle data, location tracking, user profiles qualify as personal data
- **PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry)**: Credit card and mobile payment processing
- **CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)**: If serving California residents
- **Municipal/Regional Smart City Regulations**: Varies by deployment location
- **IoT Security Standards**: NIST IoT Core, ISO/IEC 30141 for IoT systems

**Secondary Standards:**
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management system
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Service organization controls for SaaS platforms
- **OWASP ASVS**: Application security verification standard
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Comprehensive security controls
- **Accessibility Standards**: WCAG 2.1 AA for web/mobile interfaces

**Geographical Considerations:**
- **EU Deployments**: GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, NIS2 Directive
- **US Deployments**: State-specific privacy laws, municipal parking regulations
- **Multi-jurisdictional**: Data localization requirements, cross-border data transfer restrictions

### Data Classification

**Data Types:**
- **PII (Personally Identifiable Information)**: User profiles, vehicle registration data, payment information
- **Location Data**: Real-time parking location, user movement patterns, historical parking behavior
- **Payment Data**: Credit card numbers, mobile wallet tokens, transaction history
- **IoT Sensor Data**: Parking space occupancy, environmental conditions, system diagnostics
- **Communication Data**: Chat logs, voice recordings, customer support interactions

**Sensitivity Levels:**
- **Restricted**: Payment card data (PCI-DSS scope), detailed location tracking
- **Confidential**: User profiles, chat histories, vehicle registration
- **Internal**: Anonymized analytics, system performance metrics
- **Public**: General parking availability, pricing information

**Retention Requirements:**
- **Payment Data**: PCI-DSS requires 3-7 years depending on card brand
- **Personal Data**: GDPR allows "as long as necessary" - recommend 2 years post-account closure
- **Chat Logs**: Regulatory minimum 1 year, recommend 3 years for customer service
- **Audit Logs**: ISO 27001 requires minimum 1 year, recommend 7 years

**Data Residency:**
- **EU Users**: Data must remain in EU/EEA or adequacy decision countries
- **California Users**: CCPA requires disclosure of data processing locations
- **Payment Data**: May need to remain in specific geographic regions per PCI requirements

### Security Controls

**Authentication:**
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Required for admin accounts, recommended for users
- **OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect**: Integration with social login providers
- **Biometric Authentication**: Optional for mobile app enhanced security
- **API Key Management**: Secure storage and rotation for IoT devices

**Authorization:**
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Admin, Operator, User, Support Agent roles
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Location-based access for parking operators
- **API Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse and ensure fair usage
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal necessary permissions for each role

**Encryption:**
- **Data at Rest**: AES-256 for databases, file systems
- **Data in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Payment Data**: Tokenization with certified payment processors
- **IoT Communications**: Device-to-cloud encryption (LoRaWAN, NB-IoT security)

**Audit Logging:**
- **User Actions**: Login, payment, reservation activities
- **System Events**: API calls, data access, configuration changes
- **Security Events**: Failed logins, privilege escalation attempts
- **Payment Transactions**: Full PCI-DSS compliant audit trails

**Network Security:**
- **Network Segmentation**: Separate payment, IoT, and user data networks
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Protection against OWASP Top 10
- **DDoS Protection**: Essential for 99.9% uptime SLA
- **VPN/Zero Trust**: Secure administrative access

### Privacy Requirements

**Consent Management:**
- **Explicit Consent**: Location tracking, marketing communications
- **Granular Controls**: Separate consent for different data processing purposes
- **Consent Withdrawal**: Easy opt-out mechanisms in app and web interfaces
- **Cookie Consent**: GDPR-compliant cookie banners and management

**Data Subject Rights:**

**Breach Notification:**
- **72-Hour Rule**: GDPR requires notification to supervisory authority
- **User Notification**: Required if high risk to rights and freedoms
- **Incident Response Plan**: Documented procedures for breach handling
- **Forensic Capabilities**: Ability to investigate and document incidents

**Privacy by Design:**
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary data
- **Purpose Limitation**: Clear documentation of data processing purposes
- **Storage Limitation**: Automated deletion after retention periods
- **Pseudonymization**: Where possible, replace identifying information
