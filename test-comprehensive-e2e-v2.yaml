# Expected Results After Deployment:
#
# 1. KNATIVE SERVICES:
# kubectl get ksvc -A | grep -E "(user-management|customer-support|analytics-engine)"
# - user-management (from webservice)
# - customer-support-rasa (from rasa-chatbot) 
# - customer-support-actions (from rasa-chatbot)
# - analytics-engine-realtime-service (from realtime-platform)
#
# 2. INFRASTRUCTURE:
# kubectl get realtimeplatformclaims | grep comprehensive-e2e-test-v2
# - comprehensive-e2e-test-v2-infrastructure (from realtime-platform)
#
# 3. GITHUB REPOSITORY:

#
# 4. CI/CD PIPELINE ROUTING:
# - Python services (user-management, analytics-engine) → comprehensive-gitops.yml
# - RASA service (customer-support) → chat-gitops.yml
# - Detection based on presence of domain.yml and config.yml files
#
# 5. SHARED INFRASTRUCTURE:
# - PostgreSQL database (shared by all services)
# - Redis cache (shared by webservice)
# - Kafka streaming (from realtime-platform)
# - MQTT broker (from realtime-platform with iot: true)
# - Metabase visualization (from realtime-platform)
#
# 6. GITHUB ACTIONS SUCCESS CRITERIA:
# - All workflow runs complete successfully
# - Container images built and pushed to docker.io/socrates12345/*
# - No failed builds or test failures
# - OAM manifests updated in gitops repository
#
# 7. VERIFICATION COMMANDS:
# curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/shlapolosa/comprehensive-e2e-test-v2
# gh run list --repo shlapolosa/comprehensive-e2e-test-v2 --limit 10
